 Problems Included ->

1. Odd Sum Challenge (Suspicious Packet Size Analysis)
  Scenario: In a malware communication channel, odd packet sizes are flagged as suspicious.  
  Task: Given `N` packet sizes, compute the sum of all odd packet sizes.

2. Binary Count (Bitmask Permissions Audit)
   Scenario: File permissions are stored as binary bitmasks. Each `1` means a permission is granted.  
   Task: Count the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the given number.

3. Anagram Checker (Malware Code Signature Matching)
   Scenario: Malware authors shuffle variable names to evade detection.
   Task: Check if two strings are anagrams (case-insensitive, ignoring spaces). Print YES or NO.
